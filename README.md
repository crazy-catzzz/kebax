# Kebax

Kebax is a simple OS kernel which I created to understand how the CPU and the OS work at a lower level.

## Implemented features

Currently, Kebax supports these features:

- Interrupt handling
    - IRQ1 (Keyboard)
- VGA text mode video output

## TODO

I plan to add these features in the (somewhat) near future:

- Memory management
    - Physical allocator
    - Paging and virtual memory manager
